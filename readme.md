# Computer Vision Final Project Instructions

In order to run the grading script that labels 5 images using the Faster RCNN, navigate to the directory:  
```final_project/src/driver/run.py```  
and all one has to do is run the main method to get the results to print to the terminal.

If it is getting low accuracies, run it a few times so it balances out.

To get the file for the model, go to this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16i-AflLiu4HPQYAUCzRQfOra_olHsHVr/view?usp=sharing  
From downloading it there, put it in the:
```rcnn_digit_classification/src/train_and_inference/saved/``` directory in order for the run.py method to work.
